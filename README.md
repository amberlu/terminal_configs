# Configs for vim and tmux
Systems/shells tested on:
- Linux (Arch and Ubuntu)
- bash

Untested on:
- MacOS
- zsh

Run `install.sh` and follow the prompts if needed

## Requirements
`curl`  
`git`  
`Node.js` (can be automatically installed by running `install.sh`)  

## Notes
*Disclaimer:* This is a work in progress and is maintained during my spare time. It is used mostly for setting my own environment
up on new machines and as such most new features/bug fixes will occur on an as-needed basis.
If you think there is a bug that affects the tested systems/shells, please submit an issue and I may get to it at some point. No
guarantees though :)
